## :smiley: About Me :
I am thrilled to introduce myself â€“ Yersagyn, a 23-year-old with a passion for Computer Science. I had the privilege of being a student at Satbayev University, where I pursued my education in this exciting field.

Currently, I am in Astana, honing my skills at the renowned Alem Programming School. I also had the valuable opportunity to receive training at One Technologies, and you can find the relevant certificates proudly displayed on my [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linked%20In-blue?style=flat-square&logo=linkedin)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ynuraddi/) profile.

My journey has led me to work on some remarkable projects, and I am eager for you to evaluate my skills. I genuinely hope that my abilities align with what you are seeking.
